# Airbnb-analysis

### Introduction
Built an interactive Power PI dashboard to analyze the Airbnb data extracted from MongoDB Atlas. Developed a Streamlit application for trend analysis, pattern recognition, and data insights using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Explored variations in price, location, property type, and seasons through dynamic plots and charts.

 ### Problem statement

 This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning
and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic
plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based
trends. The objectives are to:
1. Establish a MongoDB connection, retrieve the Airbnb dataset, and ensure
efficient data retrieval for analysis.
2. Clean and prepare the dataset, addressing missing values, duplicates, and
data type conversions for accurate analysis.
3. Develop a streamlit web application with interactive maps showcasing the
distribution of Airbnb listings, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and
other relevant factors.
4. Conduct price analysis and visualization, exploring variations based on
location, property type, and seasons using dynamic plots and charts.
5. Analyze availability patterns across seasons, visualizing occupancy rates and
demand fluctuations using suitable visualizations.
6. Investigate location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for
specific regions or neighborhoods.
7. Create interactive visualizations that enable users to filter and drill down into
the data.
8. Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI, combining
various visualizations to present key insights from the analysis.
